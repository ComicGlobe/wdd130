            <p>Hi! My name is Porter Ray and I am from Phoenix, Arizona. I served my mission in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I was sealed to my wife last year in August. I love exploring new consumer tech products as well as longboarding in my free time.</p>

            <p>Arizona is an extremely hot and dry desert. However, it is home to 7 million people as well as the saguaro cactus, and some of the most beautiful sunsets. During the end of the summer months there are many monsoons which are large thunderstorms that bring much needed rain to the arid climate. One of my favorite facts is that it is the birthplace of both the bolo tie and the chimichanga.</p>
